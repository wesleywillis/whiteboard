## Custom Alexa Skill (Available in Alexa Skill Store)

This is a custom Alexa skill I built for myself to help practice technical interview skills.  The user can request a coding challenge from their Amazon Echo, and will be provided with a random challenge question.  Current version is minimum viable product, planned updates are: improve SSML to make Alexa speech more natural, or use recorded speech snippets, provide links on skill cards for answers, tag questions so that user can request specific types of challenges, allow user to input challenges they have passed/failed.
